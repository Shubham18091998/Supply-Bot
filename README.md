Supply Bot
The aim is to integrate your image processing knowledge to build a robot to traverse the arena and solve/complete the
task.
Problem Statement:
The built Supply Bot using Image Processing should traverse the arena to reach the City where the
Medical Aid is ready for dispatch. Hit/Strike the Medical Aid just once so that it moves
across the Dead Zone and reaches the White circular region traversing the respective Villages
for maximum outreach via the City Nodesâ€™s Sector.
In Summary,
1. On running the Python script from the console, the script should output the node
number of the City requiring the Aid, on the console.
2. The laptop running the Python Script should communicate with Supply Bot over
XBee.
3. The Supply Bot will then, start at the Capital traverse the Highway (white line) to
reach the City in need of Medical Aid.
4. Stop at the City, beep the buzzer twice, and dispatch with one time contact the
Medical Aid towards the Villages with need.
5. Once the Medical Aid reaches the Village(s) beyond the Dead Zone, the Supply Bot
beeps the buzzer once as an acknowledgment for aid dispatch.
6. The Supply Bot should now return to the Capital and beep the buzzer to indicate the
end of the run.
The Medical Aid is rendered useless and lost if it reaches and stops in the Dead Zone or
Lake.
